# My cryptopals solutions

This is a repository with my solutions to cryptopals. I am trying to solve these using only the standard library.

I have made an effort to make the code as unopinionated as possible by using `bytearray()` instead of string parameters such that users can select encodings, inputs, etc as they please as seen in the example code in each file.
